            SimplissimA empowers scientists to leverage ancestral knowledge to solve current health challenges. The goal is to design and implement simple solutions, compatible with One Health.
        </h5>
        <blockquote>
            The One Health approach allows us to come up with durable solutions widely accessible. We wish to avoid the elevated costs and the low accessibility that are classically associated with the reactive rushes to treatment.
        </blockquote>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>
            SimplissimA is based on a collaborative, multisectoral, and trans-disciplinary approach — devising solutions at the local, regional, national, and global levels.
        </h5>
        <blockquote>
            We are interested by the cross-kingdom communication – when one species transmits genetic information, which influences one another. Based on our original discovery of mitomirs, we specifically study microRNAs, which are parts of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

        <blockquote>
            <strong>2016:</strong> Local intervention of SimplissimA during an Ear-Foot-Mouth cattle epidemic in 2016 in Mauritius led to save more than 4000 animals, which were to be slaughtered.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>2018:</strong> Development of programs to prevent, treat and reach remission of ‘chronic’ diseases, e.g type 2 diabetes through ancestral remedies developed as publicly-accessible health solutions.
